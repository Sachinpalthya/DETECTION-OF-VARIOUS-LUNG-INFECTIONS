# DETECTION-OF-VARIOUS-LUNG-INFECTIONS
RESPIRATORY ANALYSIS DETECTION OF VARIOUS LUNG  INFECTIONS USING COUGH SIGNAL
Project description:Large number of people die every year of Pulmonary chronic lung diseases irrespective of their 
age. Lung sound analysis has been a key diagnostic aid to accurately detect pulmonary diseases. 
Earlier, manual detection was used which was not a dependable method to detect lung diseases 
due to various reasons like low audibility and difference in perceptions of different physicians 
for different sounds. Modern computerized analysis yield results with much higher accuracy 
and thus a better treatment can be given to patients suffering from various kinds of lung 
diseases.  
These disorders include Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, Tuberculosis and Pneumonia. 
Some of the symptoms are wheezing, shortness of breath, rhonchi and chronic cough. In this 
project we are using respiratory audio dataset to predict various diseases such as Asthma, 
Pneumonia, Bronchiectasis and many more. To implement this project, we have taken disease 
diagnosis dataset and respiratory audio dataset and then extract features from all audio dataset 
and then trained a convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm model. After training model 
we can upload any new test data to predict disease from it.
